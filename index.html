  <p class="p1">This is <em>the Gardener</em>. <em>The Gardener</em> is a drawing robot which can grow new plants in the garden, like blooming roses or symmetrical succulents. Some other times it can dig a hole or detect some crawling worms.</p>

  <p>The machinery of <em>the Gardener</em> responds to the exhibition theme “displacement”. The machine is composed of 4 180-degree motor servos and a continuous spinning table in the middle. I attached 2 pigment liner pens to the motors with adjustable handle lengths. It can draw with absolute angle control, or with a margin of error with the looseness of the handle. The machine does not draw perfect symmetry, but it can draw experimentally as restrained to the handle position and gravity. The spinning table resembles the earth quality that <em>the Gardener</em> work with.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The sound level nearby <em>the Gardener</em> correlate with the angle of one 180-degrees motor, and the spinning speed of the table as well. This another layer of sound sensor makes the machine a great listener and reactive to the surroundings.</p>

  <p>The Gardener explores the relationship between the machine and the artist. The gardening metaphor is related to both the natural creation and the human interference on nature,
    the same way the machine is both a tool and a collaborator/artist itself. Although the Gardener is does not assume human figure nor have the full sense of agency of a human,
    it still possesses the ability to create. The aesthetic is black and white and somewhat minimalistic,
    reflecting on the binaries that this machine a part of: the computer binary code,
    the obedience/disobedience,
    the creativity/nothingness. </p>
